# 🧪 Testing Space

This repository serves as a **testing environment** for experiments, prototypes, and feature validation. It is **not intended for production use**.

---

## Purpose
The Testing Space is used to:
- Safely test new features or code snippets before integration.
- Validate API connections, webhooks, and configurations.
- Conduct UI/UX trials or layout experiments.
- Share examples or temporary builds for review.

---

## Guidelines

### ✅ Do
- Keep tests isolated and labeled clearly.
- Use mock or anonymized data — never real customer or sensitive information.
- Document what each test or folder does in a short note or comment.
- Clean up obsolete files and commits periodically.

### ❌ Don’t
- Deploy from this space to production.
- Store credentials, secrets, or API keys.
- Assume anything here is stable or permanent.
